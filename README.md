# EMFDuino

EMFDuino is a project about measuring Eletric Mains Frequency (EMF) with low-cost Arduino hardware as measurement device and a Raspberry Pi Database Server and measurement interpretation computer (Also other computers are possible).
This repository contains the software for the measurement device and the middleware to connect the measurement device to the database server.
Also, the helper tools for querying and saving output from the Gridradar Database and saving data of a micromax-fgps PMU are included.

The end targeted result is an Influx Database with Electric Mains Frequency measurements for every second of the day.

This project has no commercial purpose and should only be used for research and educational purposes.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. Install Arduino IDE v2, Python and Node.js on your machine.

2. Checkout repo with:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
```

### Install necessary libraries

1. Install necessary python packages:

```bash
pip3 install requests influxdb-client-python
```

2. Change in the directory of the emf_logger_cli and install the necessary node packages:

```bash
cd emf_logger_cli
npm install
```

3. Copy the folder `rtc_methods` with its content to the Arduino library folder. The location of the Arduino library folder can be found in the Arduino IDE under `File -> Preferences -> Sketchbook location`.

4. Install the Arduino library `SparkFun_Ublox_Arduino_Library` from the Arduino IDE library manager.

5. Copy the emf_device folder to the Arduino library folder. The location of the Arduino library folder can be found in the Arduino IDE under `File -> Preferences -> Sketchbook location`.

### Data Base Setup

Please set up a InfluxDB v2 instance and create a bucket for the data.
Also configure a retention policy to not delete data, to be able to query it later.
The generation of an API token is also necessary to be able to write data to the database.

## Configuration and usage of client software

The software is configurable and usable via command line interface. Despite there are multiple operation modes possible, this tutorial focuses on the most important parts.

### Configuration

The configuration of the software components, espically the InfluxDatabaseConnection is done via environment variables:
The following talbe lists the environment variables that are used by the software components and are necessary to be set.

| INFLUXDB_TOKEN      | all               | Authentication token for the InfluxDB                                                   |
| INFLUXDB_URL        | all               | URL under which the InfluxDB is reachable in the schema: https://<URL                   | IP>:PORT |
| MICROMAX_URL        | micromax_scraper  | URL to the web interface of the micromax_fgps device in the format http://<URL          | IP>:PORT |
